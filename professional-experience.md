<p style="text-align: justify;">Lixo is a startup created at the end of 2019 that develops quality control solutions for waste management players. The heart of the solution is a Computer Vision based application. During 6 months, I've been in charge with the training and deployment of Computer Vision models.</p>  

<span style="color:#16af9d">My missions : </span>
* Implemented and trained <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz', sans-serif;">object detection</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz', sans-serif;">semantic segmentation</span> models
* Experimented several sets of hyperparameters to reach best performance
* Optimized Deep Learning models on a microcomputer
* Wrote  scientific documentation to apply for funding awards

<p style="text-align: justify;">In parallel, I wrote and defended a professional thesis named <i>"Improvement of an embedded artificial intelligence solution for the detection of waste in sorting centres"</i>, supervised by Stéphane Lathuilière (Assistant Professor at Télécom Paris in the multimedia team).</p>
