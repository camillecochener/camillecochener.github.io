<p style="text-align: justify;">Lixo is a startup created at the end of 2019 that develops quality control solutions for waste management players. The heart of the solution is a Computer Vision based application. During 6 months, I've been in charge with the training and deployment of Computer Vision models.</p> 
</br>

My missions were : 
* Implemented and trained object detection and segmentation models
* Experimented several sets of hyperparameters to reach best performance
* Optimized Deep Learning models on a microcomputer (TensorRT, NVIDIA Jetson)
* Wrote  scientific documentation to apply for funding awards

In parallel, I wrote and defended a professional thesis named "Improvement of an embedded artificial intelligence solution for the detection of waste in sorting centres", supervised by Stéphane Lathuilière (Assistant Professor at Télécom Paris in the multimedia team).
