# About me

<div style="text-align: justify">

<p>
My name is Camille COCHENER. I am passionate about Data Science and Artifical Intelligence. It's been <b><span style="color:#16af9d">4 years I'm working in Data Science</span></b> : 3 years in different companies and 1 year during which I attended a Post Master Degree in Big Data. At the present time, <b><span style="color:#16af9d">I am currently looking for a position of Experimented Data Scientist.</span></b>.
</p>  

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz', sans-serif;">
<b>To better know me :</b>  
</p>

<p>
In 2016, I obtained an <b><span style="color:#16af9d">Engineering Degree in Statistics and Data Science</span></b> applied to biological and agri-food data from <b><span style="color:#16af9d">Agrocampus Ouest</span></b> in Rennes, France. I completed my master thesis at <b><span style="color:#16af9d">Clarins Laboratories</span></b> (Pontoise, France). During the internship, I modeled the relationships between consumers' perceptions and instrumental parameters of skin mechanical properties. My supervisor was Sebastien Lê, professor and researcher in the Department of statistics and computer science of Agrocampus Ouest.
</p>

<p>
After I graduated, I joined a French <b><span style="color:#16af9d">consulting company in Statistics and Data Science</span></b>, named <b><span style="color:#16af9d">IT&M Stats (IT&M group)</span></b>. On its behalf, I had the opportunity to provide my expertise in major French companies from various sectors : industries, healthcare mutual, banks. 
</p>

<p>
To complete my Engineering Degree (equivalent to a Master Degree), I’ve undertaken a <b><span style="color:#16af9d">Post Master Degree in Big Data</span></b> at <b><span style="color:#16af9d">Télécom Paris</span></b> (which is part of the <span style="color:#16af9d">Polytechnic Institute of Paris</span>) from september 2019 to june 2020. At the same time, I’ve carried out various projects using real world data : a Kaggle <b><span style="color:#16af9d">NLP</span></b> project proposed by Jigsaw and Google in which I developed an app based on a <b><span style="color:#16af9d">multi-label Deep Learning</span></b> model to classify toxic online comments ; I've also worked with <b><span style="color:#16af9d">Karavel-Promovacances</span></b> to explore <b><span style="color:#16af9d">audio data</span></b> from their call centers and identify meaningful insights. <br>
I also participated in several hackathons : a 2-month challenge organized by <b><span style="color:#16af9d">Carrefour</span></b> and <b><span style="#1ABC9C">Ecole Polytechnique</span></b> to design a <b><span style="color:#16af9d">local Marketing Mix Model</span></b> which my team and I won ; as well as a 24-hour challenge organized by <b><span style="color:#16af9d">QMI, LFIS and SESAm</span></b>, a French fintech, to <b><span style="color:#16af9d">predict stock volatility</span></b> on announcement dates. 
</p>

<p>
I concluded my course by 6 months in a startup named <b><span style="color:#16af9d">Lixo</span></b>. Lixo develops quality control solutions based on a Computer Vision application for waste management players. I was <b><span style="color:#16af9d">responsible for the Computer Vision module</span></b>. My professional thesis was about improving the <b><span style="color:#16af9d">embedded Artificial Intelligence</span></b> solution for detecting waste in sorting centers. My supervisor was Stéphane Lathuilière, associate professor at Télécom Paris.
