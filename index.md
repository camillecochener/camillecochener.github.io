# About me

<div style="text-align: justify">

<p>
My name is Camille COCHENER. I am passionate about Data Science and Artifical Intelligence. Originally from Normandy, I'm currently living in the beautiful city of Paris in France. It's been 4 years I'm working in Data Science : 3 years in different companies and 1 year during which I attended a Post Master Degree. At the present time, I am looking for a position of Senior Data Scientist starting from February/March 2021.

<b>To better know me :</b>  
</p>

<p>
In 2016, I obtained an Engineering Degree in Statistics and Data Science applied to biological and agri-food data from Agrocampus Ouest in Rennes, France. I completed my master thesis in Clarins Laboratories (Pontoise, France). During the internship, I modeled the relationships between consumers' perceptions and instrumental parameters of skin mechanical properties. My supervisor was Sebastien Lê, professor and researcher in the Department of statistics and computer science of Agrocampus Ouest.

After I graduated, I joined a French consulting company in Statistics and Data Science, named IT&M Stats (IT&M group). On its behalf, I had the opportunity to provide my expertise in major French companies from various sectors : industries, healthcare mutual, banks.

<p>
To complete my Engineering Degree (equivalent to a Master Degree), I’ve undertaken a Post Master Degree in Big Data at Télécom Paris (which is part of the Polytechnic Institute of Paris) from september 2019 to june 2020. At the same time, I’ve carried out various projects using real world data : a Kaggle NLP project proposed by Jigsaw and Google in which I developed an app based on a multi-label Deep Learning model to classify toxic online comments ; I also worked with Karavel-Promovacances to explore audio data from their call centers and identify meaningful insights. <br>
I also participated in several hackathons : a 2-month challenge organized by Carrefour and Ecole Polytechnique to design a local Marketing Mix Model which my team and I won ; a 24-hour challenge organized by QMI, LFIS and SESAm, a French fintech, to predict stock volatility on announcement dates. 
</p>

<p>
I concluded my course by 6 months in a startup named Lixo. Lixo develops quality control solutions based on a Computer Vision application for waste management players. I was responsible for the Computer Vision module. My professional thesis was about improving the embedded Artificial Intelligence solution for detecting waste in sorting centers. My supervisor was Stéphane Lathuilière, associate professor at Télécom Paris.
