<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz', sans-serif;"><u>Objective</u> : to build a local Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) in order to analyze and predict the impact of marketing media on sales (ROI)</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I took part in the annual hackathon organized by the "Next Gen RetAIl" chair at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole Polytechnique</a>, which gathered 132 students in 26 teams. During this challenge, <a href="https://www.carrefour.fr/">Carrefour</a>, the sponsor of the chair, proposed 3 study themes: building the optimal product DNA of a shop, designing a Local MMM and optimizing the frequency and packaging of in-store supplies.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My team won the hackathon by proposing a MMM with a local granularity that focuses specifically on organic products. Our model allows to determine the business drivers of organic product sales. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Marketing Mix Modeling studies the relationships between marketing spending and business performance (i.e. revenue, sales) to determine business drivers and estimate return on investment (ROI). It helps marketing experts to better allocate their budgets on marketing channels. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To build our model, we had access to more than 30 historical datasets on all products, purchases, marketing investments and sales of Carrefour shops. Using these, we were able to train a very efficient Machine Learning algorithm, <a href="https://catboost.ai/">CatBoost</a>, and then interpret it using <a href="https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Shapley values</a>. The results were presented in the form of a user-friendly dashboard built with <a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">Dash</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The hackathon ended with a pitch session during which we provided recommendations that were in line with the <a  href="https://www.carrefour.com/fr/groupe/transition-alimentaire">food transition objectives</a> of the company to a jury of Carrefour directors.</p>
