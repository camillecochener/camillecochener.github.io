<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz', sans-serif;">Objective : to build a local Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) in order to analyze and predict the impact of marketing media on sales (ROI)</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What is a MMM ?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">XXX</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">I took part in the annual hackathon organized by the "Next Gen RetAIl" chair at Ecole Polytechnique, which gathered 132 students in 26 teams. During this challenge, Carrefour, the sponsor of the chair, proposed 3 study themes: building the optimal product DNA of a shop, designing a Local Marketing Mix and optimizing the frequency and packaging of in-store supplies.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My team won the hackathon by proposing a Marketing Mix model with a local granularity that focuses specifically on organic products. Our model allows us to better anticipate the impact of local marketing levers on organic product sales. </p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">To build our model, we had access to more than 30 datasets on all products, purchases, marketing investments and sales of Carrefour shops. Using these, we were able to train a very efficient Machine Learning algorithm, CatBoost, and then interpret it using Shapley values. The results were presented in the form of a user-friendly dashboard built with Dash.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The hackathon ended with a pitch session during which we provided recommendations that were in line with the food transition objectives of the company to a jury of Carrefour directors.</p>
